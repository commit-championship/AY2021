## Background

In line with our vision to be a premier provider for IT services, one of the goals this year is to **promote IT literacy** in NUS. On top of the existing challenge we face, COVID-19 pandemic introduces new challenges in achieving this goal. The question is, “how might we mitigate these problems?”

Through this CommIT Championship, we aim to:
1. Foster relationships between members
2. Nurture problem solving skills
3. Reinventing the wheel in creative ways to serve the NUS community
